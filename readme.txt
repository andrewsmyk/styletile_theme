Thanks for downloading the Interactive Style Tile WordPres Theme!
-------------------------------------------------------
This Theme is made possible though the combined might of 
Steve Fisher (@hellofisher) and Jesse Friedman (@professor).
It should be free of bugs and full of possibility, however 
do note that we're only humans and if you spot a bug or 
better yet have a suggestion do us a favor and tell us 
about them here - http://www.interactivestyletiles.com

Everything we do is represented in a browser so we wanted to take our 
style tiles a bit further and here it is. An in-browser style tile that 
helps establish a visual language and design direction for your project. 
It is viewable on any modern device so you can get an idea of how things 
might feel on your device. It is in version one right now, but expect 
more style goodness in the future.

Setting it all up
-------------------------------------------------------

Step 1
- Create the Pages
First step is to create the four pages. Each page needs to be assigned
the matching Template in the Page Attributes section in the editor. 
* Introduction - default template
* Style Tile 1 - Style Tile 1 template
* Style Tile 2 - Style Tile 2 template
* Style Tile 3 - Style Tile 3 template

- The Introduction Page
We feel it's vital to educate your clients on the definition of style tiles. Please feel free to use the below copy in your Introduction page, or create your own:

"WHAT IS A STYLE TILE?
Samantha Warren explains on styletil.es that:
Style Tiles are a design deliverable consisting of fonts, colors and interface elements that communicate the essence of a visual brand for the web. They help form a common visual language between the designers and the stakeholders and provide a catalyst for discussions around the vision and goals of the project. Style Tiles are similar to the paint chips and fabric swatches an interior designer gets approval on before designing a room.
As everything we do is represented in a browser we wanted to take our style tiles a bit further. So here it is. An in-browser style tile that helps us establish a visual language and design direction for your project. Plus it is viewable in any modern device so you can get an idea of how things might feel on your device."

Step 2
- Create the Menu
Next you'll need to create a menu that links up the four pages to
their respective menu items. Then add your new menu to the Primary Menu drop down and save. 

Step 3
- Theme Options (wp-admin/customize.php)
From here you can customize all the elements for each style tile. Just 
navigate to the portion you want to update and then make the changes
needed in the customizer to the left. The changes will be reflected live 
in the preview window to the right as you update each element. When you're
done just remember to hit 'save'.

Editing the options in 1. Typography will affect the Typography section of the page using the Style Tile 1 page template.

- Style Tile
At anytime all the options for each style tile can also be updated by 
accessing the 'Style Tile' settings section in the Wordpress admin. You won't see a 
preview here, but for some items this might be faster and easier.
